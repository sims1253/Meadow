Description: meadow is a collection of functions to generate datasets that can
    used in, besides other things, simulation studies (eg. via bayesim).
    It mainly consists of the functions we use with bayesim and is aiming to
    keep compatible with its most recent version, however, the functions can be
    used in any other contextas well.
